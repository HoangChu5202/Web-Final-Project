                <h2>CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party</h2>
                <p>There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were
                    having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it
                    as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. <a class="span alice"> "Very uncomfortable for the
                    Dormouse,"</a> thought Alice; <a class="span alice">"only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind."</a></p>

                <p>The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: <a class="span">" No room! No
                    room!"</a> they
                    cried out when they saw Alice coming. <a class="span alice">"There's plenty of room!"</a> said Alice indignantly, and she sat
                    down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.</p>
