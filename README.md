# Final Project
This is the final project for my CIS-207 Fundamentals of Web Programming course at Kirkwood Community College.

## Introduction
This is the first time I learn about **GitHub**, **Git**, **Visual Code** and **Markdown**.

This is what I learned in **GitHub**:
- Create a new project
- How to add a file from my computer to GitHub
- How to pull and push a file to GitHub

I also learn some basic thing in markdown too.
