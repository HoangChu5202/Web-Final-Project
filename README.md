# Final Project
This is the final project for my CIS-207 Fundamentals of Web Programming course at Kirkwood Community College.

## Introduction
This is the first time I learn about **GitHub**, **Git**, **Visual Code** and **Markdown**.

This is what I learned in **GitHub**:
- Create a new project
- How to add a file from my computer to GitHub
- How to pull and push a file to GitHub

I also learn some basic thing in markdown too.

## Chapter 1 - Introduction to web development
In this chapter I learned about how internet work, how web application work.

I started to learned about HTML and CSS. 
-  I learn some basic stuff in HTML, relationship between \< html \>, \< head\> and \< body \>
-  In CSS I learn how to change color of background, fornt-size, font-family, margin, padding and boder.

I also learned Five web development issues:
-   Users and usability
-   Cross-browser compatibility
-   User accessibility
-   Search engine optimization
-   Resopsive Web Design

I also learn how to use Figma.


## Chapter 2 - Code, Test, and Validate a Web page
In this chapter I learned about HTML syntax: how to code elements and tags, how to code attributes and how to code comments and whitespace.
In CSS syntax I learned about: How to code CSS style rules and comments and how to code basic selectors.

To test and debug a web page we should Open with Live Sever.
Short cut to indentation on Windows: Shift + alt + F.
â€˜ is different from '.
To validate a HTML file: [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).
To validate a CSS file: [ W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).


## Chapter 3 - HTML to structure a web page
In this chapter I learned about: How to code the head section.
The <meta> tag can used to:
- Identify the character set used (It will always be utf-8 for html5 documents).
- Provide a description to summarize the contents (It will be displayed in search engine results)
- Provide a list of keywords related to the page content (To possibly help with search engine optimization)
- Aid in the adjustment of content between desktop and mobile screens.
- Assist is
A recommend line to add in head section of all html file is:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
```
It will make it easier to adjust content between desktop and mobile screens.

I learned about special blocks of text. It is:
```html
- <pre> tag.
- <blockquote> tag.
- <address> tag.
```

I also learned how to use Google fonts, `<sub>` and `<sup> `tag and how to code character entities.

Using `<div>` tags whenever I need a parent element to group together a bunch of child elements. The <span> tag acts the same but is an inline element. 

Whenever linking to another website I should add the target="_blank" attribute to open the link in a new tab.
