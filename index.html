                <p class="flex_item">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is a 2019 action-adventure game developed by FromSoftware
                    and published
                    by
                    Activision. The game follows a shinobi known as Wolf as he attempts to take revenge on a samurai
                    clan who attacked him and kidnapped his lord. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation
                    4,
                    and Xbox One in March 2019 and for Stadia in October 2020.</p>

                <p class="flex_item">Gameplay is focused on stealth, exploration, and combat, with a particular emphasis
                    on boss
                    battles.
                    The game takes place in a fictionalized Japan set during the Sengoku period and makes strong
                    references to Buddhist mythology and philosophy. While creating the game, lead director Hidetaka
                    Miyazaki wanted to create a new intellectual property (IP) that marked a departure from the
                    Souls
                    series of games also made by FromSoftware, and looked to series such as The Mysterious Murasame
                    Castle and Tenchu for inspiration.</p>

            <h1>Gameplay</h1>

                <img src="./asset/images/Sekiro_Gameplay.jpg" alt="Gameplay">
                <p>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is an action-adventure game played from a third-person view. Compared to
                    FromSoftware's own Souls series, the game features fewer role-playing elements, lacking character
                    creation and the ability to level up a variety of stats, as well as having no multiplayer elements.
                    It does, however, include gear upgrading, a skill tree, and limited ability customization. Rather
                    than attacking to whittle an enemy's health points, combat in Sekiro revolves around using a katana
                    to attack their posture and balance instead, which eventually leads to an opening that allows for a
                    single killing blow.

                    The game also features stealth elements, allowing players to immediately eliminate some enemies if
                    they can get in range undetected. In addition, the player character can use various tools to assist
                    with combat and exploration, such as a grappling hook. If the player character dies, they have the
                    option of being revived on the spot if they have resurrection power, which is restored by defeating
                    enemies, instead of respawning at earlier checkpoints.</p>
